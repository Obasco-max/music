            Mavo is a 21-year-old Nigerian artist 
            known for his "Burbur Music," a blend of Afrobeats, rap, and Nigerian slang. 
            Born Marvin Oseremen Ukanigbe, he balances his fast-rising music career
             with his studies in optometry at Afe Babalola University. He gained widespread 
             recognition after the viral hit "Escaladizzy" and has since released projects like
              Ukanigbe and SANKO, collaborating with artists such as Davido, Ayra Starr, and Wizkid.
